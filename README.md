# SceneSpindle

**AI Video Production Studio.** An invite-only studio for turning scripts, ideas, code and media into reviewed films, using structured plans and trusted renderers.

For a fresh account or machine, start with [HANDOFF.txt](HANDOFF.txt).

The product combines the existing web app with Reel Studio's editing workflows. The target includes 2D/3D films and recurring episodes; those capabilities are being delivered in slices. **The current web render flow is preview-only, not a complete hosted MP4 pipeline.** See [project status](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) and [implementation plan](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

## Start locally

Use Node 22 LTS and npm. Python 3 and FFmpeg are needed for media/trace tests; MongoDB must be a replica set for transactional editing (Atlas works). From a fresh checkout:

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run typecheck
```

Create `.env.local` from `.env.example` only if it does not already exist. Supply your own Mongo URI/database and auth configuration, then `npm run dev`. Do not overwrite existing credentials. `npm run studio -- doctor` checks the local Node version and media executables without printing credentials; it does not connect to MongoDB or providers.

## Use any AI assistant or IDE

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [the editing workflow](docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md). No Claude, Cursor, Codex or other assistant subscription is required to run the repository.

```sh
npm run studio -- capabilities
npm run studio -- schema
npm run studio -- validate-plan path/to/plan.json
npm run studio -- captions path/to/words.json --max-words 3
```

The commands above are the **planned interface and are not runnable yet**. They will return JSON and fail with nonzero exit status when inputs are invalid. Capabilities reflect the implemented v1 explainer contract, not the whole roadmap. Caption grouping consumes measured word times; it does not create timestamps from a prompt.

## Architecture and contribution

Next.js/TypeScript, MongoDB, provider adapters, HyperFrames and FFmpeg. Planned heavy Blender rendering runs on a paired PC or Azure worker. Private media stays local unless explicitly opted into hosted processing. Third-party paid services remain disabled without configured authorization; Azure sponsorship balance is not yet verified.
